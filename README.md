# Code Jam 3

In a survery we recently conducted, we asked what theme people wanted to see for this code jam. The most popular option,
with 26/115 votes, was **The world ends in 10 minutes**. Thus, the task for this code jam involves creating a game under that theme.

This task is a little more freeform than the other code jams we've had so far - we're happy to accept games in any form,
*as long as they fit that theme.* You may use PyGame, Kivy, Curses/Unicurses, Pyxel, web frameworks like Flask, or anything else
your team desires. **Please provide instructions on how to set up and run your game within the README where necessary**.

Remember that teamwork is paramount - You *will need to work together*. For this jam, we've assigned a leader for each team
based on their responses to the application form. Remember to listen to your leader, and communicate with the rest of your team!

# Tips

* Please lint your code, and listen to the linter. We recommend **flake8**, and you can use `pipenv run lint` to run it.
* Remember to work closely with the rest of your team.
* We're not expecting the next Assassins Creed or God of War. Don't get too ambitious and overstretch yourselves -
  it's much better to have a finished project.
* Remember to fill out the __Project Information__ section below.
* If you haven't used Git before or have other questions about the task or code jam, we recommend reading
  [the Code Jam section on our wiki](https://wiki.pythondiscord.com/wiki/jams).

# Setting Up

As usual, you should be using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Take a look
[at the documentation](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if you've never used it before. In short:

* Setting up for development: `pipenv install --dev`
* Running the application (assuming you use our project layout): `pipenv run start`

# Project Information

`# TODO`

## Description

You wish to destroy the world, but only have 10 minutes to do it. There is a
suspiciously large quantity of lemons lying about outside, so you come up with
the brilliant plan of squeezing them all to drown the planet in lemon juice!

## How to run

`pipenv run start`

## How to play

Collect as many lemons as possible before time runs out. Avoid falling into the
lemon juice.

Controls are listed on the main menu.
